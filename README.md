# ETL Project

## Overview:
Group Project in which the ETL process was used to analyze and compare population metrics and minimum wage data for all states during the years 2009 and 2010 using Python, Pandas, Matplolib, SQL and SQLAlchemy.


## Datasets:
Our first dataset was retrieved from Kaggle.com. It displays the minimum wage "maximum and minimum" for each state in the United States during the years 1968 and 2017.
Our second dataset was retrieved from data.world.com. It displays 4 sociological metrics for all 50 states during different years. 



## Workflow:

A relational database called 'ETL_db’ was created in PostgresSQL pgAdmin 4 and the following commands were used to create the table schema. Four tables were created, and the column names and value types were specified. The ‘state’ column was set as the primary key in each table because it is present in all tables.
